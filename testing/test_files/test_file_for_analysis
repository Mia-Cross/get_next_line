This is the 1first line of my te
tfile.\nI'm trying to see if I ca
n read multiple lines\nwhatever t
he lenght\nof\nsaid line.\n\nAnd I'm
 not sure what would happen if I
 put an empty line in the middle
 of my file.\nI don't even know ho
w I can tell my program to print
 only a single line.\nWhat even i
s "a line" ??\nSo many questions.
..\n\nLike if I write some kind of
 super-long sentence with no new
line character, I wonder what wo
uld happen, like is it supposed
 to read it until I write a back
slash n ?\nLet's try it out !
